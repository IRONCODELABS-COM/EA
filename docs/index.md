## 2. Iron Code Labs Enteprise Architecture (ICL EA)
- **ICL EA is a subset of [TOGAF](https://www.opengroup.org/togaf)**
   - It is taylored, by our EA navigator, for your smooth sailing
   - Guding principle: Aligned with the aim of performing small but measurable steps delivering visible benefits

## 3. Capbility Maturity Model (CMM)

Why Climbing the CMM Ladder

CMM is a formal foundation for managing and measuring organisation capability and maturity. It is based on TOGAF CMM. For details please [proceed here](pages/cmm.md).

ICL EA has developed a simplified CMM adoption Method. It is simplified because it is aligned to the core idea of fast but feasible delivery under the guidance of EA.

## 4. How is Feasible Delivery achieved?


### Decoupling Business and Technology
- Business declares products
- Technology implements products
- EA guides the organization and manages the whole process

### Evolving feasibly through measurabe cycles

- Architect
- Develop
- Deploy
- Repeat

By following the ICL BPT Methodology. Core of the BPT Methodology is [**BPT Meta Loop**](pages/bpt.md).


- **Business** declares products
- **Product** bridges business needs and technical capabilities
- **Technology** implements products
- **EA** guides the organization and manages the whole process

[BPT Meta Loop](pages/bpt.md) is the agile method for guiding the overall enterprise process: from Architecture to Product delivery, guided by our simplified TOGAF approach.

#### Key actors in the BPT Metodology
## 5. [AI is inside](pages/AI.md)

- Our guding principle is to understand why and how we and our customers use AI. 
- We are not used by AI. 
- If things go wrong we do not blame it on AI. 
- AI is marketing term. LLM is enginering. 
- We do not blame it on the tool.
