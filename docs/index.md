- **ICL EA is a subset of [TOGAF](https://www.opengroup.org/togaf)**
  - It is tailored, by our EA navigator, for your smooth sailing
  - Guiding principle: Aligned with the aim of performing small but measurable steps delivering visible benefits

<summary><strong>3. Capability Maturity Model (CMM)</strong></summary>

Why Climbing the CMM Ladder?

CMM is a formal foundation for managing and measuring organisation capability and maturity. It is based on TOGAF CMM.

ICL EA has developed a simplified CMM adoption Method. It is simplified because it is aligned to the core idea of fast but feasible delivery under the guidance of EA.

Existence of **Taxonomy** and its widespread usage is a sign of organization higher on the CMM ladder.

- [CMM Details](cmm.md)
- [Taxonomy](taxonomy.md) — provides the structural foundation that characterizes a capable and mature enterprise

<summary><strong>4. How is Feasible Delivery Achieved?</strong></summary>

### Decoupling Business and Technology

- Business declares products
- Technology implements products
- EA guides the organization and manages the whole process

### Evolving Products Feasibly

NOTE: Product by its widest possible definition. Although in the context of ICL EA, primary focus is on software systems, products and services.

- Each step is a measure of EA efficiency

1. Require
2. Develop
3. Deploy
4. Evaluate
5. Repeat

### By Following the ICL BPT Methodology

Core of the BPT Methodology is [BPT Meta Loop](bpt.md).

#### Key Actors in the BPT Methodology

- **Business** declares products
- **Product** bridges business needs and technical capabilities
- **Technology** implements products
- **EA** guides the organization and manages the whole process

[BPT Meta Loop](bpt.md) is the agile method for guiding the overall enterprise process: from Architecture to Product delivery, guided by our simplified TOGAF approach.

<summary><strong>5. AI is Inside</strong></summary>

- Our guiding principle is to understand why and how we and our customers use AI.
- We are not used by AI.
- If things go wrong we do not blame it on AI.
- AI is marketing term. LLM is engineering.
- We do not blame it on the tool.
