# How we do not Document Software Architecture

The theoretical foundation is well established — see *Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, 2nd Edition* (Clements et al., SEI, 2010): [SEI library](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/documenting-software-architectures-views-and-beyond-second-edition/) · [InformIT](https://www.informit.com/store/documenting-software-architectures-views-and-beyond-9780321552686) · [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=UTZbsrA4qAsc). The book introduced the three-viewtype framework (Module, Component-and-Connector, Allocation) and stakeholder-driven view selection. It remains the rigorous reference. It is not a practical handbook for modern delivery teams.

The frameworks below are.

## C4 Model

**Author:** Simon Brown, 2018
**Reference:** [c4model.com](https://c4model.com)

![alt text](c4.png)

> **The Problem**: Very much implementation oriented method. The whole of Enteprise and Logical Architecture are over-simplified into "Context". Enterprise , System, Business, Governance architecting are just a "Context" in the C4 World.
{: .note}

> C4 Does not fit the simple but strong and overarching ICL Taxonomy
{: warning.}


Four diagram types, four audiences, one supposedly consistent notation:

| Level | Audience | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| Context | Business, non-technical | System in its Business and IT Landscape — segments and external dependencies |
| Container | Architects, developers | Major deployable units — apps, databases, services |
| Component | Developers | Internal structure of a single container |
| Code | Developers | Classes, interfaces — usually auto-generated |

Start at Context (Conceptual) and stop at the level your audience needs. Most conversations are resolved at Container. Code-level diagrams are almost never worth maintaining by hand.

> The term "Container" is unfortunate — since 2013 it reads as Docker container to most engineers, which is one specific deployment technology, not the general concept C4 intends. A clearer synonym is **Deployable Unit** or **Building Block**: it captures the essential meaning (something that runs independently and communicates over a network) without the Docker collision. When introducing C4 to a team, use "Deployable Unit" in conversation and reserve "Container" only when citing the C4 spec directly.
{: .note}

C4 uses a simple, tool-agnostic notation. Diagrams can be produced in any diagramming tool or as code via [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com) (Brown's own tool) or the [C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML) library.

> Four diagrams cover most of what teams actually need to communicate.

## arc42

**Authors:** Gernot Starke and Peter Hruschka
**Reference:** [arc42.org](https://arc42.org)

arc42 is a lean, structured template for architecture documentation — twelve sections covering context, solution strategy, building blocks, runtime, deployment, decisions, quality, and risks. It is worth knowing it exists.

Teams working within the[ [ICL A](../icl-adm/index.md)DM](../../kb/icl-adm/index.md) should not adopt arc42 as a documentation structure. Th[e ICL A](../icl-adm/index.md)DM already defines the documentation scaffold through its phases and deliverables; introducing arc42 alongside it creates two competing structures for the same content. arc42 is designed for teams without a governing ADM — it fills the gap that TOGAF an[d ICL A](../icl-adm/index.md)DM already fill here.

> Know it. Do not use it here.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Origin:** Michael Nygard, 2011
**Reference:** [adr.github.io](https://adr.github.io)

An ADR captures one decision: the context that forced it, the options considered, the decision taken, and its consequences. ADR is not Architecture Visualisation per se, it is a single type deliverable point back to the Architecture from the development, where it is referenced.

**At the presence of the [ICL ADM](../icl-adm/index.md), Deliverables and REQ's, ADRs are redundant at the organization level.** The [ICL ADM](../icl-adm/index.md) produces hierarchical requirements with decisions already embedded as deliverables — that is precisely what an ADR is attempting to construct from scratch. In ACL ADM governing REQuirements hierarchy exists; ADRs is semanticaly poorer. 

The more accurate name for what development teams actually use them for is **Development/Design Decision Records (DDRs)**: a way to trace code-level choices back to architecture. That is a legitimate and useful practice — but it belongs entirely within the Development aka [Technology segment](../Business_Product_Technology/Technology.md) of the [BPT](../Business_Product_Technology/index.md). DDRs are a private engineering artefact, disconnected from the BPT flow. Architecture does not read them; they are a breadcrumb trail for the dev. team that owns the code.

> If the team wants DDRs, that is fine. They are internal to Development and invisible to the BPT loop.

**Tooling:** [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) (CLI), [Log4brains](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains) (web UI), or plain files in a `/decisions` folder.

## In Practice

| Concern | Tool |
|---|---|
| Visual communication across levels | C4 |
| Documentation structure and decision hierarchy [| ICL A](../icl-adm/index.md)DM deliverables |
| Code-level traceability (Development only) | DDRs (ADRs repurposed) |

***A minimal viable documentation practice*** within th[e ICL A](../icl-adm/index.md)DM: C4 Context and Container diagrams for stakeholder communication[, ICL A](../icl-adm/index.md)DM deliverables for decisions and requirements. DDRs are optional and internal to the Development team.
