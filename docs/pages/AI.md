## AI-assisted Software Development

I have nothing against it, as long as we are alligned on the 2025 DORA Report. LLM of choice is your own assistant. But you are accountable for your output.

#### [Please make sure you have read 2025 DORA Report](https://dora.dev/research/2025/dora-report/)

My humble opinion is it will resonate true. Until further notice. And if it ever comes that notice will be far in the future.

#### You are acountable for your claims on your competence. LLM or no LLM and which LLM etc. is all your responsibility.

## Addendum

The **DORA AI Capabilities Model** report, a companion guide to the 2025 State of AI-assisted Software Development report, serves as a practical guide to the seven capabilities that amplify the benefits of AI. For each of the seven core capabilities, this report details implementation strategies, specific tactics for teams to get started, and methods for monitoring progress and fostering continuous improvement.
